Welcome to my personal webpage !

I'm a researcher working in the field of Quantum Information Theory. I have a strong expertise in different aspects of Quantum Cryptography: from the design of practical implementations using Quantum Optics, to advanced mathematical methods for proving finite-size security. He is interested in both numerical and analytical methods, and has experience with different adversarial models, from Device-Dependent to (semi-)Device-Independent security.

I previously received my PhD from the University of Brussels in 2019, under the supervision of Stefano Pironio. I then moved to Canada, where I was a postdoctoral researcher in the groups of Norbert Lütkenhaus (University of Waterloo) and Hoi-Kwong Lo (University of Toronto). I'm currently working as a postdoc at Telecom Paris.
